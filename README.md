# Rules

If you think something needs to be re-defined, please forks this repo and send a PR and we will review it. There is a current restriction of 160 characters so take that in mind!

1. **Be kind and respectful.** - This will all be way more fun if everyone is nice to each other. You can disagree on something while not making it personal.

2. **Stick to the topic in posts.** - This is a community for Software Engineering. For anything else, please post in another appropriate community. Also don't use non-relevant hashtags in posts.

3. **Promote meaningful content, not products.** - No ads, self-promo, or other kinds of promotions. OSS/FOSS projects are excepted. No use of URL shorteners.

4. **No qoute posting.** - Copying a link to your post and publishing it here is not allowed. Make a post in the community, and click: "Also share with followers" it provides more reach.

5. **No general career advice.** - Any career advice post must contain questions and/or discussions that notably benefit from the participation of aspiring or professional software engineers.

6. **No spamming.** - Don't spam the same content repeatedly or respond to a post with a quote in a new post or use the hashtag #news. Spam will result in ban. Limit to 2 hashtags.

7. **No memes.** - Although we love memes, we want to have a community of serious discourse. Find another appropriate community for memes.

8. **No posts in languages other than English.** - The only language that should be used here is English. And that includes links to resources as well.

9. **No low-effort posts.** - For example, no posts with bare links/reposts without added insightful comment/description. Very short posts not encouraging discussion are also low-effort.
